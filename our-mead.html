        <p class="talk">Mead is considered to be the most ancient of alcoholic beverages. The actual origin is lost in antiquity, but the unique qualities and flavors have remained much the same since the beginning</p> 
        
        <p class="talk">Mead was the traditional drink for newlyweds in the days of yore. The new couple was provided with a month's supply of mead with which to celebrate their nuptuials. This is where the Honeymoon came from.</p>
        
        <p class="talk">Mead is, in its most basic form, a mixture of honey and water which is then fermented. Various flavors are added to the production of mead, such as different fruit flavors</p>
        
        <p class="talk">We use only local, organic honey, and for our flavoring, we use only organic ingredients. Our current mead flavors are maple and cinnamon/vanilla. Both have fine hints of the added flavors.</p>
